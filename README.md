- Extracts structured data from AI response using regex.

### 2️⃣ AI Image Creation
- Uses `FLUX.1-dev` to generate high-resolution images based on the prompt.
- Ensures consistent quality and creativity.

### 3️⃣ Automated Instagram Posting
- Uploads the AI-generated image to Instagram using `instagrapi`.
- Posts at regular intervals without manual intervention.
